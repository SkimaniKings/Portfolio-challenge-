# 💼 Simon Kimani's Sci-Fi Portfolio | PLP Academy Hackathon 1 🚀

Welcome to my **personal portfolio website**, created as part of the **July 2025 Cohort Hackathon** at PLP Academy!  
This project is a **sci-fi inspired, single-page website** that showcases my background, skills, projects, and passions — all built using only **HTML and CSS**.

## 🎯 About This Project

This website serves as a digital representation of who I am — a passionate and growing frontend developer with a love for futuristic UI, problem solving, and building cool things with code.

> ⚠️ **Challenge Constraint**: No JavaScript, Font Awesome, or external libraries used.  
Only HTML & CSS — all creativity had to be expressed within those limits.

## 🎨 Theme and Creative Direction

I chose a **terminal/sci-fi hacker aesthetic** to make my site stand out visually and creatively. Every section uses glowing highlights, hover animations, glitchy reveals, and layered visual depth to create a cohesive, immersive feel.

This theme expresses:
- My love for innovation and storytelling through UI
- How constraints (no JS) don’t limit creativity — they *inspire* it
